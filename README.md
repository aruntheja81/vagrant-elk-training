ELK ([Elasticsearch], [Logstash], and [Kibana]) Training
==================================================

The purpose of this repository is to start from the basics of getting your
ELK Stack up and running. We will be starting from the very basic installation
of [Logstash] and working our way up to the other components which make up ELK
Stack. Also now called the Elastic Stack.
